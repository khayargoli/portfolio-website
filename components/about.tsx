        As a freelance software developer, I specialize in building <span className="font-medium">web and mobile applications. </span>
        I love working with modern frameworks and technologies to build fast, responsive, and engaging web and mobile apps.

        problem-solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem.
